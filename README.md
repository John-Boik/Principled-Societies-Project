# Principled-Societies-Project
Empowering Individuals, Organizations, and Communities to Solve Problems That Matter

## Synopsis

This repository contains code for the interactive website and, eventually, for other components of the [Principled Societies Project](http://www.PrincipledSocietiesProject.org). Its mission is to to empower individuals, organizations, and communities to solve or successfully address [problems that matter](http://www.PrincipledSocietiesProject.org/socio_prospectus) --- problems that relate to core needs of the group and others. To accomplish its mission, PSP develops computational models and other tools that groups can use in problem solving. For example, it develops models to forecast local-area disease rates based on local-area demographic, socioeconomic, and other factors. It also develops fundamentally new social choice systems (e.g., economic systems), as flexible platforms, intended for parallel implementation at the community level via volunteer civic clubs. A primary example is the LEDDA Economic Direct Democracy Framework, based on the 2014 book *Economic Direct Democracy: A Framework to End Poverty and Maximize Well-Being*, by John Boik.

The website contains an (initial) interactive model of a steady-state, idealized, Token Exchange System (TES), a local currency system that is one of eight components of the LEDDA framework. The token is a local electronic currency that 
circulates alongside the national currency (the dollar, in the example model). Visitors can adjust starting conditions and model variables and view impacts on token and dollar flows. 

## Motivation

Communities worldwide face a challenging mix of existing and emerging problems including climate change, high unemployment, pollution, budget shortfalls, forced migrations, and income inequality. The seeming inability of societies to effectively address these and other challenges like them suggests that underlying social choice systems might be sub-optimal. Social choice systems include portions of economic, governance, and legal systems, broadly defined. The work here seeks to address two overarching questions:

1. What characteristics would relatively optimal social choice systems exhibit, and how is relative optimality defined and measured?
2. How could research and development of more optimal systems best proceed?
