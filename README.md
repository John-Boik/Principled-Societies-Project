Developing the LEDDA Economic Direct Democracy Framework

## Synopsis

This repository contains code for the new interactive website (under construction) and, eventually, for other components of the [Principled Societies Project](http://www.PrincipledSocietiesProject.org), the organization developing the LEDDA Economic Direct Democracy Framework. The LEDDA Framework is a set of innovations that could one day help communities reinvent themselves as strong, secure, resilient, and prosperous. It is based on the 2014 book Economic Direct Democracy: A Framework to End Poverty and Maximize Well-Being, by John Boik.

The new website will include interactive models, the initial one being a steady-state model of an idealized Token Exchange System (TES), a local currency system that is one of eight components of the LEDDA framework. The token is a local electronic currency that 
circulates alongside the national currency (the dollar, in the example model). Visitors can adjust starting conditions and model parameters (e.g., target family income) and view impacts on token and dollar flows. 

## Motivation

Communities worldwide face an increasingly dangerous mix of existing and emerging problems including climate change, high unemployment, pollution, budget shortfalls, forced migrations, homelessness, political polarization and extremism, and income inequality. The seeming inability of societies and civilization to effectively address these and others like them suggests that underlying social choice systems might be sub-optimal. Social choice systems includes economic, governance, and legal systems. They are also known as decision-making systems. The work here seeks to address two overarching questions:

1. What characteristics would relatively optimal social choice systems exhibit, and how is relative optimality measured?
2. How could research and development of more optimal systems best proceed?

The approach suggests a new multidisciplinary technology and academic program that we term *wellbeing centrality*: the design, testing, promotion, and use of social choice systems that place wellbeing measurement, evaluation, forecasting, and deliberation at the center of decision-making activities. 

The Local Economic Direct Democracy Association (LEDDA) framework is one example of a wellbeing-centrality design for a local  (e.g., city, county) economic system. It is intended to function in parallel with existing systems. 

A LEDDA is a membership‐based, community development association open to all resident individuals, business, nonprofits, and other organizations. Members voluntarily join a LEDDA and manage their local system via a novel form of online direct democracy. The stated purpose of the framework is to maximize collective wellbeing, broadly defined. 

An agent-based, stock-flow consistent [simulation model](https://ijccr.net/2014/10/14/first-micro-simulation-model-of-a-ledda-community-currency-dollar-economy/) has been published that illustrates some of the framework’s intended characteristics and functions. 

This repository and the interactive website are newly started in Oct 2016. Please pardon the dust while we organize the code, effort, and components. Its a mess, for the time being.
