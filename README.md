Developing the LEDDA Economic Direct Democracy Framework

## Synopsis

This repository contains code for the new interactive website (under construction) and, eventually, for other components of the [Principled Societies Project](http://www.PrincipledSocietiesProject.org), the organization developing the LEDDA Economic Direct Democracy Framework. The LEDDA Framework is a set of innovations that could one day help communities reinvent themselves as strong, secure, resilient, and prosperous. It is based on the 2014 book Economic Direct Democracy: A Framework to End Poverty and Maximize Well-Being, by John Boik.

The new website will include interactive models, the initial one being a steady-state model of the Token Exchange System (TES), a local currency system that is one of eight components of the LEDDA framework. Visitors can adjust parameters of the model, such as the desired family income target, and view results of token and dollar currency flows. The token is a local electronic currency that circulates alongside a national currency (the dollar, in the example model).

## Motivation

Communities worldwide face an increasingly dangerous mix of existing and emerging problems including climate change, high unemployment, pollution, budget shortfalls, forced migrations, homelessness, and income inequality. These can be viewed as symptoms of dysfunction within underlying social choice (societal decision-making) systems, which include economic, governance, and legal systems. Principled Societies Project seeks to address two overarching questions:

1. Are existing social choice systems optimal, by some appropriate measure?
2. If not, what characteristics might optimal systems exhibit and how might communities and societies transition toward their successful use?

A multidisciplinary field of Wellbeing Systems Science and Engineering (WSSE) is suggested to addresses these and related questions. The LEDDA framework is one example from the field that describes a novel economic system that is itself a form of direct democracy. 

The Local Economic Direct Democracy Association (LEDDA) framework is a proposed community level (e.g., city or county) economic system intended to function in parallel with existing systems. A LEDDA is a membership‐based, community development association open to all resident individuals, business, nonprofits, and other organizations. Members voluntarily join a LEDDA and manage their local system via a novel form of online direct democracy. The stated purpose of the framework is to maximize member wellbeing and to benefit the global public. 

An agent-based, stock-flow consistent [simulation model](https://ijccr.net/2014/10/14/first-micro-simulation-model-of-a-ledda-community-currency-dollar-economy/) has been published that illustrates some of the framework’s intended characteristics and functions. 

This repository and the interactive website are newly started in Oct 2016. Please pardon the dust while we organize the code, effort, and components. Its a mess, for the time being.
