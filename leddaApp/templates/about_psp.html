      <p>The mission of the Principled Societies Project (PSP) is to support the science-based de novo development and testing of new 
      cognitive architectures for the large-group setting that are fit for purpose. A cognitive architecture is the means and mechanics 
      employed to perform cognition.
      For a group it includes the set of norms, rules, mechanisms, institutions, tools, procedures, sensors, and analytic processes that aid
      cognition. The group might be a formal political entity, like a city or nation, or a more informal and smaller group, like a corporation
      or community association. Core societal systems (e.g., governance, economic/financial, legal systems) are considered to be
      part of the cognitive architecture of a society.

      <p class="wrap-p">Principled Societies Project was founded in 2012 by John Boik. Dr. Boik 
          received a BS in civil engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder; a master's degree 
          in acupuncture and Oriental medicine from Oregon College of Oriental Medicine, Portland, 
          Oregon; and a PhD in biomedical sciences from the University of Texas, Health Sciences Center, 
          Houston, where he studied cancer biology. He completed postdoctoral work at Stanford 
          University, in the Department of Statistics. He currently is a research fellow at and serves on 
          the Scientific Advisory Board of the Active 
          Inference Institute. And he is the author of 
          <a href="book_edd_about"><em>Economic Direct Democracy</em></a> and other books and papers. Interests
