  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col-lg-12 col-xl-12 p-sect">
      <p>We empower individuals, organizations, and communities to focus on and solve (or successfully address) <i>problems that matter</i>.
      </p>
      
      <p>One could say we're in the information, computation, AI, decision-making, complex-adaptive-systems design business. Only as a nonprofit, developing and using open-source tools and platforms. We're also in the awareness and wisdom business. After all, doesn't wisdom imply the capacity to solve difficult problems? And doesn't awareness imply information?
      </p>
      
      <p>What are <i>problems that matter</i>? Communities worldwide face a mix of difficult, specific challenges, including climate change, high unemployment, pollution, income inequality, high rates of preventable diseases, crime, and biodiversity loss. Organizations and individuals face their own kinds of specific challenges, like  budget shortfalls and decisions about careers and health. More generally, however, <i>problems that matter</i> are the ones that directly relate to core human needs. Groups inherit their core needs from those of individuals, as illustrated in Figure 1.
      </p>

      <figure class="center">
      <a name="figure1">
        <img alt="problem-solving process, summary" src={{ url_for('static', filename="images/intelligent_community_brief.png") }}> 
      </a> 
      <figcaption>Figure 1. Overview of the group problem-solving process</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>Human groups cooperate to solve problems in much the same way that groups of any species, even bacteria, cooperate to solve problems. Viewed abstractly, in the process illustrated in Figure 1, individuals and groups have needs, gather information about their environment, process the information and evaluate options, make decisions, and then take actions. Actions may alter conditions, and the process starts over again.
      </p>
      
      <p> Said another way, groups <i>compute</i>. They sense and process information in order to predict, or anticipate, what will happen next if certain actions (or no actions) are taken. Some of the computation happens at the individual level, and some is orchestrated at the group level.
      </p>
      
      <p>Of course, for simple organisms like bacteria, the anticipatory apparatus is very simple. For complex animals, like humans, the apparatus is very sophisticated and can include the brain, mechanical sensors, software, and supercomputers. Even so, the internal and external models that humans build are necessarily imperfect and based on incomplete information. The only perfect model of the world is the world itself. Thus, the impacts of our actions are also uncertain (note the question mark in the figure). 
      </p>
      
      <p>As tagged in the figure, <i>social choice systems</i> are the components of the problem-solving process that are subject to human design. These include software and computational tools, information infrastructure, programs, procedures, and rules. Most important, they include the conceptual models and world views on which a social choice system is based. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Social choice systems can also be called <i>problem-solving</i> or <i>decision-making systems</i>. For communities and societies, primary social choice systems are economic/financial/monetary; governance/political; and legal/justice systems, broadly defined. Economic, governance, and legal systems, for short. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Again, we help individuals, organizations, and communities to focus on and solve <i>problems that matter</i>. We do so by offering improvements to all aspects of social choice systems. In particular, we research and develop information, decision-making, and computational tools and infrastructures, all eventually integrated into a comprehensive open-source problem-solving platform. And we provide products and services to clients based on what we develop. Perhaps most important, our efforts and products reflect new, more realistic world views that are emerging at the frontiers of science.
      </p>
    
      <p>Or, at least, this is what we will do, once we secure the funding necessary to get started. Our <a href="blog">blog articles</a> provide background information. More information about products and services, including a grant and social investor slide deck, is on the <a href="prospectus" ><b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> Program</a> page.

      <p>Like your job?  Hate it?  Too much stress in your life? Life too boring? Frustrated with the government or economy? We want to know!  Please take our wellbeing surveys. Your responses help us understand current levels of wellbeing and your views on existing and desired social choice systems. This is an opportunity to tell your story. Results will be summarized on this website and/or in scientific papers, media articles, and elsewhere. Please take all four surveys, and encourage friends and colleagues to do the same. Each survey has about 50 questions.
