  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col-lg-12 col-xl-12 p-sect">
    <p>Think of your community (e.g., your city or county, or neighborhood within a city or county) as a living, breathing superorganism. Then ask the following: How healthy is it? How well does it learn from experience? How well does it adapt to changing conditions? Is it sustainable and vibrant? Most important of all, how well does it solve <a href="https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/solving-problems-that-matter-could-be-the-next-big-thing-8a068dfa4ce2", target="blank"><i>problems that matter</i></a>?
    </p>
    
    <p>Now imagine a future in which your superorganism is wise and empowered, and so is able to solve its problems. Imagine that levels of public health and collective wellbeing (social, economic, financial, and environmental) are far higher than those today. Imagine education and health care systems that are affordable and of high quality. Work days are shorter, leaving more time for family, community, and other matters. Rates of crime and preventable disease are lower. The air and water are cleaner and the environment is well-cared for. What would your life feel like? 
    </p> 

  <p>One last step. Imagine zero poverty and high and equal incomes for every adult in your community. All incomes are at the national average, which for a US family today is about $110,000. The very conception of money has changed, as now it is understood as a voting tool in a transparent system of economic direct democracy. A community might even have its own local currency that circulates alongside the national one. The people of your community are engaged in voting with money and in making collective funding decisions as a means to solve problems that matter. Wealth is measured as collective wellbeing, and a community gathers and assesses rich data to gauge how their levels of wellbeing are changing over time.
  </p>
  
  <p>This future, for your community, and for global networks of cooperating communities, is called Economic Direct Democracy.  We empower communities to achieve it. There are many versions and possible designs, allowing each community to express its own unique character.
  </p>    
  
  
  <div class="blue-sect">
    <h2>How We Empower</h2>
  </div>
  
  <p>The mission of Principled Societies Project is to empower individuals, organizations, and communities to solve problems that matter. We do this in part by developing predictive models of public health, demographics, human resources, energy use, and other matters of concern. And we develops and test concepts, tools, and platforms for new forms of economic direct democracy. 
  </p>  
      
      <p>In particular, we develop and promoting new and better <i>social choice systems</i>. Figure 1 illustrates the general problem-solving process. A more complete description is provided in the article <a href="ideals_democracy_capitalism">Is Solving Problems the Ideal of Democracy and Capitalism?</a> Tagged in the figure, social choice systems (<span style="color:#ff0000ff">A through D</span>) are the components of the problem-solving process that are amenable to design and innovation. If these components are well designed and well integrated, and they reflect a realistic and broad worldview, the problem-solving process is likely functional. If not, the process could be dysfunctional and problems could go unsolved. 
      </p>

      </a> 
      <figcaption>Figure 1. Overview of the group problem-solving process</figcaption>
      </figure> 

      <p>We innovate all aspects of social choice systems. For example, we develop computational models that help communities predict what will happen next. The models forecast changes in a wide range of socioeconomic, demographic, public health, and wellbeing factors. And they allow examination of "What if?" scenarios.   
      </p>
      
      <p>We also develop fundamentally new, integrated social choice systems, as flexible open-source platforms. These are designed to excel as problem-solving systems and are intended for implementation at the community level via volunteer civic clubs. A prototype is the <a href="ledda_framework" >LEDDA framework</a>. One can think of it as providing a novel, alternative version of a rising minimum wage and a rising basic income, plus all the benefits of economic direct democracy. 
      </p>
      
      <p>We have a start, as evidenced by the articles, models, and other materials on this website. But the bulk of the development work remains, awaiting funding. To see where we are going, read our <a href="blog">blog articles</a>. More information about our products, including a slide deck for funders, is on the <a href="prospectus" ><b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> Program</a> page.
