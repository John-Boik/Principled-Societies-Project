            Climate change, biodiversity loss, and other social and environmental problems pose grave risks. Progress so far has been incremental, and as 
            a result scientists, global policy experts, and the general public increasingly call for bold change across all sectors of society. At 
            least two kinds are conceivable, both of which involve societal systems (e.g., financial, economic, and governance systems) and their 
            institutions, policies, rules, and priorities:
            <ol>
                <li>reform of existing systems </li>
                <li>transformation, understood as the development of and migration to new, improved systems.</li>
            </ol>
            
            The focus of the Principled Societies Project is transformation. It is dedicated to science-based R&D on new societal systems that 
            can better serve the common good. Here, a society is viewed as a superorganism that expresses the intrinsic purpose of achieving and maintaining 
            vitality. The systems of a society are understood as a societal cognitive architecture. The goal is to develop, test, and implement
            new systems that better facilitate learning, decision making, and adaptation (i.e., societal cognition).
