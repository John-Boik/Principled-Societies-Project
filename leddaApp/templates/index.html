      <p>Our mission is to empower individuals, organizations, and communities to focus on and solve (or successfully address) <a href="socio_prospectus">problems that matter</a>. One could say we're in the problem-solving, public health and wellbeing, information and computation, decision-making, complex-adaptive-system design business.
      </p> 

      <p>What are problems that matter? Communities worldwide face a mix of specific challenges, including:
      </p>

      <ul class="blue-sect two-columns">
        <li>
          <span>Climate change
          </span>
        </li>  

        <li>
          <span>Joblessness
          </span>
        </li>  

        <li>
          <span>Pollution
          </span>
        </li>                

        <li>
          <span>Income inequality
          </span>
        </li>  

        <li>
          <span>Excess disease
          </span>
        </li>  

        <li>
          <span>Biodiversity loss
          </span>
        </li>        
      </ul>

      <p>Organizations and individuals face their own kinds of specific challenges, like budget shortfalls and decisions about careers and health. More generally, however, problems that matter are the ones that directly relate to core human needs. 
      </p>
  
      <p>Figure 1 illustrates a general, idealized group problem-solving process. A group inherits core needs from individual members, as well as from non-members that the group is concerned about. It gathers and stores information (<span style="color:#ff0000ff">A</span>); processes information and predicts outcomes for potential actions (<span style="color:#ff0000ff">B</span>); evaluates predicted outcomes in part using emotional information (<span style="color:#ff0000ff">C</span>); and makes decisions (<span style="color:#ff0000ff">D</span>). A group takes actions (<span style="color:##803300">E</span>) based on decisions, and those actions may impact conditions (<span style="color:##803300">F</span>). Learning occurs as the process cycles. 
      </p>      

      <figure class="center">

      <figcaption>Figure 1. Overview of the group problem-solving process</figcaption>
      </figure> 

      <p>As tagged in the figure, <i>social choice systems</i> (<span style="color:#ff0000ff">A through D</span>) are the components of the group problem-solving process that are amenable to design (the components that can be intentionally altered by humans). If these components are well designed and well integrated, the problem-solving process is functional. If not, the process could be dysfunctional and problems could go unsolved. 
      </p>
      
      <p>For communities and societies, primary social choice systems, or more accurately, primary subsystems of the total social choice system, include economic, governance, and legal systems, broadly defined.
      </p>
      
      <p>To give the flavor, the social choice (sub)system pertaining to the Legislative Branch of the US federal government includes Congress and its rules and procedures. And it includes the rules and regulations that govern Congressional elections, as well as the Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control, and any other agency that collects, stores, processes, or models data in order to aid the Legislative Branch in decision-making. Further, it includes eduction programs that assist voters, as well as the process by which money influences Congressional elections, policy, and legislation. Among the most important components of any social choice system, including the Legislative Branch, are the conceptual models and world views upon which it is based.  
      </p>  
      


      
      <div class="blue-sect">
        <h2>How We Empower</h2>
      </div>

      <p>We focus at the community level and innovate any and all aspects of social choice systems that are available for innovation. In particular, we research and develop information, decision-making, and computational models, tools, and applications that can aid individuals, organizations, and communities in problem solving. We also integrate these into comprehensive, flexible, open-source problem-solving platforms. We provide products and services to clients based on what we develop.      
      </p>
      
      <p>For example, we develop a suite of computational models to forecast the burdens of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other preventable diseases and conditions, for small areas (like zip codes), based on small-area socioeconomic, environmental, lifestyle, and other factors. These models can be used for budgetary or planning purposes, business decisions, and to explore community interventions that might improve public health and wellbeing. 
      </p>
      
      <p>As another example, we develop fundamentally new economic system designs, intended for implementation at the community level via volunteer civic clubs, in parallel with existing systems. A prototype is the <a href="ledda_framework" >LEDDA framework</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Our initial <a href="http://ijccr.net/2014/10/14/first-micro-simulation-model-of-a-ledda-community-currency-dollar-economy/" target="blank"> simulation model</a> of an idealized LEDDA illustrates how it eliminates poverty in a US county and more than doubles the mean family income of participants, regardless of work status. The unemployment rate drops to one percent. One can think of the LEDDA framework as providing a novel, alternative version of a rising minimum wage and a rising basic income, plus all the benefits of economic democracy. 
      </p>

      <p>We have a start, as evidenced by the articles, models, and other materials on this website. And we have other preliminary models that are not yet described here. But the bulk of the work remains, awaiting funding. To see where we are going, read our <a href="blog">blog articles</a>. More information about products and services, including a grant and social investor slide deck, is on the <a href="prospectus" ><b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> Program</a> page.

Your responses help us understand current levels of wellbeing and your views on existing and desired social choice systems. This is an opportunity to tell your story. Results will be summarized on this website and/or in scientific papers, media articles, and elsewhere. Please take all four surveys, and encourage friends and colleagues to do the same. Each survey has about 50 questions.
