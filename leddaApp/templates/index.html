      <p>Can you imagine a world where communities solve or successfully address <a href="https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/solving-problems-that-matter-could-be-the-next-big-thing-8a068dfa4ce2", target="blank"><i>problems that matter</i></a>? Problems that matter arise when core shared needs&mdash;physical, psychological, social, economic, and environmental&mdash;are insufficiently met. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Here's one of many possibilities:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>Imagine a community where incomes are high, nearly equal, and secure for every family, regardless of work status. Wealth is measured as collective wellbeing. Money is a bona fide voting tool in economic democracy, and so its conceptually different from how we now view it. <br ><br >

Jobs are meaningful, engaging, and empowering. People cooperate for a common cause, which is to further elevate collective wellbeing. Organizations cooperate similarly. Work days are shorter. Information flows freely. Crime and rates of preventable disease are low. Education, research, and local nonprofits and small businesses are well funded. Nature is cared for and repaired.
      </blockquote> 

      
      <p>This and other bright futures are possible. All that is required is that we become good at solving problems that matter. Our mission is to empower individuals, organizations, and communities to do just that.
      </p>

      <div class="blue-sect">
        <h2>How We Empower</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>We empower by developing new and better <i>social choice systems</i>. Figure 1 illustrates the general problem-solving process. A more complete description is provided in the article <a href="ideals_democracy_capitalism">Is Solving Problems the Ideal of Democracy and Capitalism?</a> Tagged in the figure, social choice systems (<span style="color:#ff0000ff">A through D</span>) are the components of the process that are amenable to design and innovation. If they are well designed and well integrated, and they reflect a realistic and broad worldview, the problem-solving process is likely functional. If not, the process could be dysfunctional and problems could go unsolved. 
      </p>      

      <figure class="center">
      <a id="figure1">
        <img alt="problem-solving process, summary" style="width: 85%; height: 85%" src={{ url_for('static', filename="images/intelligent_community_brief.png") }}> 
      </a> 
      <figcaption>Figure 1. Overview of the group problem-solving process</figcaption>
      </figure> 

      <p>We innovate all aspects of social choice systems. For example, we develop computational models that help communities predict what will happen next. The models forecast changes in a wide range of socioeconomic, demographic, public health, and wellbeing factors. And they allow examination of "What if?" scenarios.   
      </p>
      
      <p>We also develop fundamentally new, integrated social choice systems, as flexible open-source platforms. These are designed to excel as problem-solving systems and are intended for implementation at the community level via volunteer civic clubs. A prototype is the <a href="ledda_framework" >LEDDA framework</a>. One can think of it as providing a novel, alternative version of a rising minimum wage and a rising basic income, plus all the benefits of economic direct democracy. 
      </p>
      
      <p>We have a start, as evidenced by the articles, models, and other materials on this website. But the bulk of the development work remains, awaiting funding. To see where we are going, read our <a href="blog">blog articles</a>. More information about our products, including a slide deck for funders, is on the <a href="prospectus" ><b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> Program</a> page.
