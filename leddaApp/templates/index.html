<h1>LEDDA: Innovation for Thriving, Resilient Communities</h1>

<p>Communities worldwide face dangerous mixtures of current and emerging problems stemming from climate change, high unemployment, pollution, budget shortfalls, infrastructure decay, homelessness, forced migrations, income inequality, high-rates of preventable diseases, job loss through robotics, biodiversity loss, and/or other issues. Those communities that thrive in the 21st Century may well be the ones that become smarter, more organized, and more focused on solving local problems in light of global challenges.</p>

    <p> The LEDDA Framework is a set of innovations that could one day help communities reinvent themselves as strong, secure, resilient, and prosperous. It is based on the 2014 book <i>Economic Direct Democracy: A Framework to End Poverty and Maximize Well-Being</i>.</p> 
    
    <h2>What is an economic system and what should an optimal one do?</h2>
    <p>It is helpful to think of an economic system as a <i>social choice system</i>. A society uses an economic system to help decide which products to produce, how they will be distributed, who will benefit, how wastes will be managed, how workers will spend their time, who holds decision-making power, and so on. As with any human-created technology, deep innovation is possible and should be expected.</p> 

<p>Five claims are made: 
    <ol>
    <li>An <i>optimal</i> economic system is designed to monitor and maximize <i>collective wellbeing</i>.</li>

    <li>Existing systems are far from optimal. As an example, Harvard researchers recently gave the US economy a grade of F, for failure. Climate change, poverty, severe inequality, financial crises, environmental degradation, homelessness, and other serious problems are signs of sub-optimality.</li>

    <li>In any economic system, money functions as a voting tool. If income and wealth are unequally distributed, economic voting power is unequally distributed. If transparency is lacking, voting events and their results are hidden from the public.</li>

    <li>Once incomes are sufficiently high, the promise of higher personal income is not needed to motivate behavior. In the long run, a system that uses financial gain as a carrot ends up rewarding and encouraging selfishness and inequality. Healthy humans are naturally motivated by tasks that help others or the environment, that build skills or knowledge, that are interesting or creative, that meet social needs, or that otherwise have meaning. Motivation in an optimal economic system would be based on the natural human drive for meaning.</li>

    <li>Innovation of economic systems is best studied at the local (e.g., community, city, county) level, using volunteer participants, and as part of a scientific program of simulations, field trials, and inquiry. Small-scale innovation guided by science is relatively inexpensive and low risk. Some trials could be made safe-to-fail. Systems that excel in one local area can be tested in others. Systems that produce great benefits might spread virally. The R&D and field testing approach is similar to what occurs for many new and complex technical products.</li>
    </ol>
    
In summary, profound system innovations are needed and should be expected. In partnerships with community, civil society, and other groups, academics, scientists, and engineers will have critical roles to play in developing and testing new designs that better elevate wellbeing, encourage cooperation, and use money in expressing deeper and more transparent forms of democracy.</p>

<h2>Provisional definitions</h2>
    <dl>
	  <dt>Social choice system:</dt>
      <dd>A formal or semiformal system of rules, regulations, and conduct by which a society makes collective choices. Social choice systems include economic, governance, and legal systems. Also known as <i>decision-making systems</i>.</dd>
    
    <dt>Optimality:</dt>
      <dd>As applied to social choice systems, the comparative functional capacity of a system to elevate and robustly maintain collective wellbeing.</dd>           
	
	  <dt>Collective wellbeing:</dt>
	    <dd>The current and anticipated degree to which individuals, natural environments, and ecosystems collectively flourish. A high degree of wellbeing implies vibrancy, resilience, sustainability, diversity, creativity, and health. Wellbeing levels can be monitored, indexed, and modeled.</dd> 

    <dt>Wellbeing Systems Science and Engineering (WSSE):</dt>
      <dd>The nascent multidisciplinary field of academic study that focuses on the design, development, testing, implementation, management, monitoring, and assessment of ever more optimal social choice systems. The theme is <i>wellbeing centrality</i>, reflecting the central attention that wellbeing receives in optimal social choice systems.</dd>

<h2>LEDDA framework</h2>

<p>The <i>Local Economic Direct Democracy Association</i> (LEDDA) framework is a sophisticated WSSE project that aligns motivations for economic behavior with a more realistic understanding of human nature and needs. It can be understood from different perspectives as:
<ul>
  <li>A new type of local (community level) membership-based economic system that acts as an overlay to an existing economy</li>
  <li>A system of economic democracy that offers all members roughly equal influence over economic decisions</li>
  <li>A mechanism to massively fund local schools, nonprofits, small businesses, public works, research, and other beneficial groups and endeavors</li>
  <li>A platform to share intellectual property and increase local self-sufficiency in food, manufacturing, and other sectors</li>
  <li>A means to achieve higher incomes, meaningful jobs, and a high degree of income equality</li>
  <li>An economic system in which job creation and environmental protection and reclamation are highly compatible</li>
  <li>A social welfare system that eliminates poverty</li>
  <li>A network of transparent, globally networked economic systems that encourage fair trade, cooperation, and collaboration </li>
  <li>A new way to understand economic systems and the role of money</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Innovation at the structural level</h2>
<p>The LEDDA framework is a novel system of economic direct democracy that uses money as a voting tool and that holds as a purpose the maximization of collective wellbeing.</p>

<p>In  concept, a LEDDA is a (nonprofit) membership-based organization, similar to a civic club. Individuals and businesses voluntarily choose to become members, at no cost. In most democratic nations, it is anticipated that <b>no legislative action will be needed</b> to start a LEDDA. Once the open-source framework is developed, the primary requirement will be a local group of roughly one thousand interested individuals and businesses. Computer simulations based on local conditions can help inform potential members about expected benefits.</p> 

<p><b>Take this survey: Would you like your local community to host a presentation or event in which potential benefits of the LEDDA framework are explained and discussed? [ survey button, results button ]</b></p> 

<p>In a functioning LEDDA, members collectively decide the long-term trajectory of their local economy, including how they will spend their time and attention; they deliberate and vote in LEDDA governance and, via the LEDDA financial system called the Crowd-Based Financial System (CBFS), they fund the types of jobs that they want and that they believe are useful and meaningful. Because money functions as a democratic voting tool, a LEDDA acts to achieve a high and equal income for every member family. Over time, economic voting power becomes evenly distributed.</p>

<p>In a published agent-based model of an idealized system in a US county, the annual income of member families increased over a period of years to reach a final target of 110,000 tokens and dollars (T&D). The <i>token</i> is a transparent local electronic currency that circulates alongside the national currency. One token equaled one dollar in purchasing power. The 110,000 T&D target was for post-CBFS income---pre-tax income after mandatory contributions to the CBFS are made. At the simulation's end, the post-CBFS income of every member family was about equal to the 90th percentile of family income at the start of the simulation. The dollar portion (65% of final income) was about equal to the national average family income.</p>

<p>The simulation was illustrative, not predictive. In it, 90% of families in the county eventually join the LEDDA because it is in their best financial interests to do so. The framework is designed so that <b>every family that joins a LEDDA sees an income gain</b>.  In effect, a LEDDA pays people to become members.</p>

<h2>Who should be interested?</h2>
<p>Many groups might benefit from and have interest in WSSE programs and the LEDDA framework. One driver for interest is that once a LEDDA is established, it's CBFS can potentially fund member nonprofit and for-profit organizations at a massive level. In the published simulation model, which illustrated a LEDDA of only 10,000 adults, annual CBFS funding was in the <u>billions of T&D</u>. Each member chooses how their contributed portion of these funds will be spent. </p>

<p><b>Take this survey: If you were to distribute 90,000 T&D annually to local nonprofits, schools, public works, etc., which ones would you choose?  [ survey button, results button ]</b></p> 

<p><b>Take this survey: To encourage a university to create the world's first WSSE program, would you donate at least $20 annually to help fund a program, once started? Would you seek a WSSE degree or certificate if one was offered?  [ survey button, results button ]</b></p>

  </tr>  
   
  <tr>
    <td>Local governments (including cities and counties)</td>
    <td>Tax receipts and other revenues to local (and state/national) governments could rise dramatically, even double or triple. In the published model, total tax payments tripled over time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Local schools, including higher education and research</td>
    <td>LEDDA members could and likely would spend CBFS funds on public education (at all levels and grades) and on research aimed at improving collective wellbeing</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Local farms and small businesses</td>
    <td>A special arm of the CBFS exists to fund local farms and businesses with loans and subsidies. Interest-free loans are also offered. Further, LEDDA members would want to shop at and support member businesses in order to build a strong circulation of local currency.</td>
  </tr>

  
  <tr>
    <td>Employees</td>
    <td>Members use the CBFS to fund the types of jobs that they feel are meaningful and useful. Because the goal of a LEDDA is to improve collective wellbeing, most jobs will serve this purpose. </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Families falling below the 90th percentile of income</td>
    <td>Every family that joins a LEDDA should see an income gain over baseline. In the published model, the final income target was about 110,000 T&D, near the 90th percentile of starting family income.</td>
  </tr>
    
  <tr>
    <td>Families falling above the 90th percentile of income</td>
    <td>The purpose of a LEDDA is to maximize collective wellbeing. One could expect a LEDDA to improve public health, reduce crime, reduce pollution, improve cooperation, and bring other benefits. These efforts help all people, regardless of whether they are LEDDA members or not.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Public health agencies and health advocacy groups</td>
    <td>LEDDA members could and likely would spend CBFS funds on public health and disease prevention programs. Also, by increasing family income and by funding education and other beneficial programs, the factors (social determinants of disease) associated with high disease rates would improve.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Environmental groups</td>
    <td>By aligning economic activity with the purpose of maximizing collective wellbeing (which includes environmental wellbeing), and by funding local nonprofit organizations, a LEDDA can fund jobs in environmental protection and restoration and otherwise act to improve environmental health and wellbeing</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Nonprofit organizations</td>
    <td>A special arm of the CBFS exists to fund nonprofit organizations with donations. Interest-free loans are also offered. The nonprofit sector can grow as large as a LEDDA chooses, and CBFS funding allows wages to be paid at the income target. In a yet-unpublished simulation model, a LEDDA chooses to employ more than half of the member workforce in the nonprofit sector. </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Labor unions</td>
    <td>A LEDDA eventually achieves a high and equal income for all members. Moreover, it funds meaningful jobs of the membership's choosing. Secure, high-wage, quality jobs are of central concern to labor unions.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Religious, spiritual, and social conscious groups</td>
    <td>The purpose of a LEDDA is to maximize collective wellbeing. Naturally, a LEDDA works toward a more just, peaceful, caring, and cooperative society, free of poverty and destitution. A LEDDA is also deeply democratic and highly transparent by design, which alone can produce social benefits.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Open-source, open-design, and commons groups</td>
    <td>The LEDDA framework incorporates a platform to share intellectual property that resembles a pool of open source IP. Moreover, a LEDDA could and likely would spend CBFS funds to create IP that helps improve wellbeing. Software development, arts, media, technology, and other creative endeavors are likely to receive funding. Real property (for example, park land and housing) could also be funded and held in common. </td>
  </tr>


  <tr>
    <td>Public banking, credit union, and basic income groups</td>
    <td>Public banks and community credit unions are natural partners. For example, a LEDDA might partner with a local credit union to handle some aspects of currency transactions and savings. Potentially, this could involve billions in token and dollar flows annually, even for a modest size LEDDA. The LEDDA framework can be viewed as providing a basic income to all members, only rather than a minimal basic income it provides a high and equal income.</td>
