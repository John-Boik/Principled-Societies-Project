      <p>The mission of the <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> program is to help individuals, organizations, and communities focus on and solve (or successfully address) <i>problems that matter</i>. <a href="socio_prospectus">Problems that matter</a> are the ones that directly relate to core human needs. <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> offers improvements to all aspects of social choice systems (see Figure 1), which are the components of the general problem-solving process that are amenable to design.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> develops and tests:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="blue-sect ledda">
        <li>
          <span>Computational models and tools, including models used for scenario planning and for forecasting local-area resource and wellbeing status
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Information architecture and infrastructure, including sensing and secure storage and retrieval
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Communication, finance, supply chain, purchasing, reporting, and decision-making software and applications related to the group problem-solving process.
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Designs of human-oriented programs and procedures, including designs of education and research programs related to social choice system function
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Designs of rules describing how a social choice system operates and self-adapts
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Theoretical models and world views upon which a social choice system is based
          </span>
        </li>                  
      </ul>

      <p>In time, these components are integrated into a comprehensive, flexible, open-source problem-solving platform (a type of "platform cooperativism") that communities can use to improve their capacity to solve problems that matter. 
      </p>

      <figure class="center">
      <img alt="problem-solving process" src={{ url_for('static', filename="images/intelligent_community.png") }}>  
      <figcaption>Figure 1. Community problem-solving process</figcaption>
      </figure>            
      
      <p>Although Figure 1 illustrates the problem solving process for a community, the same general process applies to any organization or group, as per <a href="/#figure1" >Figure 1</a> on the homepage. Thus, our clients include individuals, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, and local, state, and national governments.
      </p>
      
      <p>The first efforts of <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> will focus on developing computational models to forecast local-area socioeconomic, population/demographic, public health, and wellbeing conditions based on local-area variables. For example, one model will forecast local-area cancer burden based on local-area socioeconomic, environmental, and other conditions. 
      </p> 
      
      <p>Phases I-III, each 2-3 years, create the initial integrated problem-solving platform. Starting in Phase IV, <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> begins to offer parallel complements to the core elements of existing social choice systems (economic, governance, and legal systems). These fundamentally new social choice system designs undergo scientific field testing via volunteer local-area civic clubs organized for that purpose. The <a href="ledda_framework" >LEDDA framework</a> is an early-stage prototype of one such local economic system.

      <p>Below is a grant and social investor slide deck. If you are a foundation or social investor, or have contacts and wish to help, please send us a note via the <a href="contact" >contact</a> page. A confidential prospectus is available on request. An excerpt of the prospectus, containing only background information, is posted on <a href="https://medium.com/p/prospectus-for-socio-prospectus-ca4c4cfb8bb7" target="blank" >Medium.com</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>Note that the slide deck and prospectus focus on the full, long-term <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> program. Individual components of the program can be funded separately. For example, our computational models to forecast local-area cancer, diabetes, heart disease, crime, and other diseases and social conditions, based on local-area factors, can be funded separately.
