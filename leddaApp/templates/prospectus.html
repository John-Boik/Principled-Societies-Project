      <p>The mission of the <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> program is to help individuals, organizations, and communities focus on and solve (or successfully address) <i>problems that matter</i>. <a href="socio_prospectus">Problems that matter</a> are the ones that directly relate to core human needs. To fulfill its mission, <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> seeks to improve all aspects of social choice systems (see Figure 1), which are the components of the general problem-solving process that are amenable to design. It conducts R&D, tests, promotes, implements, services, monitors, and reports on new and/or improved social choice system components and integrated platforms. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Its focus includes topics such as:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="blue-sect ledda">
        <li>
          <span>Computational models and tools, including models used for scenario planning and for forecasting local-area resource, socioeconomic, public health, and wellbeing status
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Information architecture and infrastructure, including sensing and secure storage and retrieval
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Communication, finance, supply chain, purchasing, reporting, and decision-making software and applications related to the group problem-solving process.
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Human-oriented programs and procedures, including education and research programs related to social choice system function
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Rules describing how a social choice system operates and self-adapts
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Theoretical models and world views upon which a social choice system is based
          </span>
        </li>                  
      </ul>

      <p>Over time, <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> integrates the components it develops into comprehensive, flexible, open-source problem-solving platforms (types of "platform cooperativism") that communities can use to improve their capacity to solve problems that matter. 
      </p>

      <figure class="center">
      <img alt="problem-solving process" src={{ url_for('static', filename="images/intelligent_community.png") }}>  
      <figcaption>Figure 1. Community problem-solving process</figcaption>
      </figure>            
      
      <p>Although Figure 1 illustrates the problem solving process for a community, the same general process applies to any organization or group, as per <a href="/#figure1" >Figure 1</a> on the homepage. Individuals too, solve problems by a similar process. Thus, our clients include individuals, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, and local, state, and national governments. In particular, clients include local-area volunteer "civic clubs" organized to test and implement new social choice system platforms.
      </p>
      
      <p>The first efforts of <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> will focus on developing computational models to forecast local-area socioeconomic, population/demographic, public health, and wellbeing conditions based on local-area variables. For example, one model forecasts local-area cancer burden based on local-area socioeconomic, environmental, and other conditions. 
      </p> 
      
      <p>In Phases I-III, each 2-3 years, a series of models and tools are developed. Products and services based on these are provided to clients starting in Phase II. By the end of Phase III, an initial integrated social choice system platform is constructed. Starting in Phase IV, <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> conducts scientific field testing of the platform via local-area civic clubs. The <a href="ledda_framework" >LEDDA framework</a> is an early-stage prototype of one such platform, a local-area economic system. Platforms function in parallel to, as an overlay of, existing social choice systems.

      </p>
      
      <p>Below is a grant and social investor slide deck. If you are a foundation or social investor, or have contacts and wish to help, please send us a note via the <a href="contact" >contact</a> page. A confidential prospectus is available on request. An excerpt of the prospectus, containing only background information, is posted on <a href="https://medium.com/p/prospectus-for-socio-prospectus-ca4c4cfb8bb7" target="blank" >Medium.com</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>Note that the slide deck and prospectus focus on the full, long-term <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> program. Individual components of the program can be funded separately. For example, our computational models to forecast local-area cancer, diabetes, heart disease, crime, and other diseases and social conditions, based on local-area factors, can be funded separately.
