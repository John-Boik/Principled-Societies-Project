      <p><b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> is the primary program of Principled Societies Project. Its aim is to innovate any and all aspects of social choice systems that are avaialble for innovation. As illustrated in <a href="/#figure1" >Figure 1</a> on the homepage, social choice systems are those components of the group problem-solving process that are amenable to human design. <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> conducts R&D, tests, promotes, implements, services, monitors, and reports on new and/or improved social choice system components and integrated open-source platforms. Our other program, the <a href="ledda_framework" >LEDDA framework</a>, is a prototype of a particular local economic system, which could become a <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> platform.
      </p>
      
      <p><i>Groups</i> in Figure 1 include organizations, communities, and societies. Individuals too, solve problems by a similar process. We focus on the community level, and our potential clients include individuals, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, and government agencies. Potential clients especially include local-area volunteer "civic clubs" organized to test and implement new social choice system platforms.

        <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>Focus areas for <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> include:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="blue-sect ledda">
        <li>
          <span>Computational models, including models for scenario planning and for forecasting small-area (e.g., zip code level) resource, socioeconomic, public health, and wellbeing status
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Information architecture, tools, and applications, including survey design and secure data storage and retrieval
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Communication, finance, supply chain, purchasing, payment, reporting, and decision-making tools and applications related to the group problem-solving process
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Local digital currencies that communities can implement as components of the problem-solving process
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Education programs related to social choice system function
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Theoretical models and world views upon which social choice systems are based
          </span>
        </li>                  
      </ul>


      <p>To give a bit better idea about the core human needs that drive group decision making (the center of Figure 1), and the span of information topics (item A of Figure 1) that can be involved, Figure 2 provides some examples.

        <h2>Development Plan</h2>
      </div>

      <p>If full funding is secured, development will occur in three phases, each about 2-3 years. At lower levels of funding, phases might last longer and models and applications might be constructed sequentially, rather than in parallel. 
      </p>
      
      
       <p>Phase I will develop computational models to forecast small-area socioeconomic, population/demographic, public health, and wellbeing status based on small-area factors. For example, one model will forecast small-area cancer burden based on small-area socioeconomic, environmental, lifestyle, and other factors. 
       </p>
       
       <p>At the start of Phase II, we will begin to offer products and services based on these models to clients. Revenues provide the bulk of funding for Phase II and III development.  
      </p> 
      
      <p>Phases II and III will improve and expand the models and develop associated applications and tools. By the end of Phase III, an initial integrated social-choice-system platform is completed. Scientific field testing of platforms begins after Phase III. Platforms function in parallel with existing social choice systems, and are tested via local-area volunteer civic clubs organized for that purpose.  
      </p> 
      
      <div class="blue-sect">
        <h2>Slide Deck</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>Below is a grant and social investor slide deck. If you are an interested foundation or social investor, please send us a note via the <a href="contact" >contact</a> page. A prospectus is available on request. For background information, and to better understand the transformative social and environmental impact that <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> could produce, read "<a href="socio_prospectus">Solving Problems That Matter Could Be the Next Big Thing</a>" and "<a href="economy_of_meaning">An Economy of Meaning, Or Bust</a>."  
      </p>

      
      <p>Note that the slide deck addresses the full <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> development program, Phases I through III. Individual components of the program can be funded separately, and proposals can be tailored to a funder's mission and interests. For example, the computational model to forecast small-area cancer burden can be funded separately.
