      <p><b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> is the primary program of Principled Societies Project. Its aim is to develop new and better social choice systems. As illustrated in <a href="/#figure1" >Figure 1</a> on the homepage, social choice systems are those components of the group problem-solving process that are amenable to design and innovation.
      </p>
      
      <p>The <i>relative fitness</i> of a social choice system is a measure of its problem solving capacity and the degree of collective wellbeing that problem-solving activity produces. The challenge is to continually improve social choice systems so that fitness continually increases. There's no upper limit to collective wellbeing. 
      </p>
      
      <p><b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> conducts R&D, tests, promotes, implements, services, monitors, and reports on new and/or improved social choice system components and integrated open-source platforms. Our other program, the <a href="ledda_framework" >LEDDA framework</a>, is a prototype of a particular local economic system, which could become a <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> platform.

        <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>Focus areas for <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> include:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="blue-sect ledda">
        <li>
          <span>Computational models that forecast socioeconomic, demographic, resource, public health, and wellbeing status for small-areas (e.g., Census tracts and counties). These models also allow examination of "What if?" scenarios.
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Information systems and applications, including survey and data repository design
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Communication, finance, supply chain, and decision-making applications
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Local digital currency systems
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Education programs related to social choice system function
          </span>
        </li>  
        <li>
          <span>Theoretical models and worldviews upon which social choice systems are based
          </span>
        </li>                  
      </ul>


      <p>We focus on the community level, and our potential clients include individuals, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, and government agencies. Potential clients especially include local-area volunteer "civic clubs" organized to test and implement new social choice system platforms.
      </p>


      <div class="blue-sect">
        <h2>Development Plan</h2>
      </div>

      <p>If full funding is secured, development will occur in three phases, each about 2-3 years. At lower levels of funding, phases might last longer and models and applications might be constructed sequentially, rather than in parallel. 
      </p>
      
      
       <p>Phase I develops open-source computational models to forecast small-area socioeconomic, demographic, public health, and wellbeing status based on small-area factors. For example, one model will forecast cancer burden. 
       </p>
       
       <p>At the start of Phase II, we begin to offer subscription and consulting/customization services to clients. Our business model somewhat resembles that of RedHat Inc., which provides services for the open-source Linux operating system. Revenues provide the bulk of funding for Phase II and III development.  
      </p> 
      
      <p>Phases II and III improve and expand on previous models. By the end of Phase III, an initial integrated social-choice-system platform is completed. Community based scientific field testing of platforms begins in Phase IV. Platforms function in parallel with existing social choice systems.  
      </p>

        <h2>Slide Deck</h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>Below is a slide deck for funders. The slide deck addresses the full <b><i>Socio prospectus</i></b> development program, Phases I through III, in the big picture. We will soon post a slide deck that focuses on Phase I.
