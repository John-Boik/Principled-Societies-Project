<h1>Generation of Synthetic Income Distributions</h1>

<p>Starting income distributions for different unemployment rates are generated by sampling 2011 US Census microdata files for Lane County, Oregon (Ruggles et al., 2010). The process used is described in [ref], with a brief overview given here.</p>

<p>In 2011, Lane County mean and median household incomes were $53,049 and $40,584, respectively (Census, 2014). The unemployment rate was 11%, and the average household size was two adults. National mean and median 2011 household incomes were higher, at $65,253 and $47,198, respectively, when adjusted to a two-adult household (Census, 2014). Mean Lane County household income is also lower than the mean of all US county means. In this respect, Lane County is typical. Just as income inequality exists between households, viewed nationally, inequality also exists between counties.</p> 

<p>The preliminary step in the simulation is to generate a population of individuals and families. This is done by specifying an adult population size (10,000, 20,000, and 100,000 persons); a labor participation rate (65 percent); an initial unemployment rate (7 percent); and a fraction of employees who work for nonprofit organizations (7 percent). A virtual individual is generated and binomial probability functions are used to randomly assign workforce/NIWF status, employed/unemployed status (for those in the workforce), and nonprofit/standard business employer status (for those who are employed).</p> 

<p>An income for each employed individual is generated by randomly sampling the set of Lane County income data above a certain threshold ($10,050 annually). Similarly, an income for each unemployed and NIWF individual is generated by sampling the set of income data below the threshold.</p> 

<p>Finally, individuals are grouped into families. For simplicity, assignments are random. This means that incomes of family members are unrelated, a condition not likely to be met in real life. If assignment had produced a positive association between spouse incomes, the generated family income distribution would have had thicker tails---somewhat more families would have very low incomes because both individuals would be low earners. Likewise, somewhat more families would have very high incomes because both individuals would be high earners.</p> 

<p>But such an association would not substantially alter the meaning of results produced. First, the generated population is representative, by some measure. The threshold income value mentioned previously was chosen so that family mean and median incomes in the generated population closely match those published for Lane County. Second, initial unemployment and NIWF rates are realistic. Third, regardless of the shape of the income distribution, 90 percent of families will fall into the target population and eventually become members. Fourth, in the simulation, job creation and membership growth occurs independent of families who have base incomes above the 90th percentile.</p> 

<p>As previously mentioned, the dollar economy apart from token-dollar flow is held at a snapshot. Prior to the introduction of tokens in Year 1, all agents are in equilibrium and all variables are static; no agent accumulates dollars, and incomes of individuals do not change. This is verified by running the simulation for a three-year burn-in period prior to Year 1.</p>
